Analysis of City of Ottawa Dataset on Garbage and Recycling Service Requests

## Foreword

This assignment explores the analysis of a dataset from the City of Ottawa, aiming to uncover insights and narratives that reflect the community's dynamics. By examining the data, I hope to highlight important trends and patterns that can inform decision-making and contribute to a better understanding of urban life in Ottawa. Through this analytical journey, I aim to enhance my skills in data storytelling and provide a clearer picture of the factors influencing our city.


## 1. Introduction

In this assignment, I will analyze a dataset from the City of Ottawa, focusing specifically on service requests related to garbage and recycling issues during August 2024. The dataset includes various service requests, including the types of issues reported, their locations, and the dates they were filed. This data was collected by the City of Ottawa through their public service reporting systems, allowing residents to submit concerns regarding waste management.

The dataset is part of a larger collection of service requests and was updated on October 3, 2024. For this analysis, I will explore the cleaning and analysis process, including generating exploratory charts and identifying potential stories within the data. I will cover the following sections: Getting Data, Understanding Data, Potential Story, and Conclusion.


## 2. Getting Data

Steps on How to Import Data into Google Sheets:

Download the Dataset: Visit the City of Ottawa's open data portal and download the dataset in CSV format onto your computer.
Open Google Sheets: Go to Google Sheets and click on "Blank Spreadsheet" to create a new spreadsheet.
Import the Dataset:
Click on File > Import.
Click on Browse and select the City of Ottawa CSV file that you downloaded earlier.
Choose "Comma" as your separator type.
Review the Imported Data: Once the data is imported, check the first few rows to confirm that it has been imported correctly.
Screenshot: Below is a screenshot of the dataset immediately after importation, showing the column headings and the first 20 rows of data:

Public Link: You can access my Google Sheets spreadsheet using the following link: =IMPORTHTML("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7Ryu3pO4VM5O9kqNR0iGk7LKg3tLzBn49_cBt8p9_U/edit?usp=sharing)


Dataset Overview:

The dataset contains 261,200 rows and 11 columns (labeled A to K).
Overall, the data appears to be well-organized and clearly labeled, making it easy to read and understand.
However, I noticed that there are many instances of /N in columns G, H, and I, which likely indicates missing information in those fields. This will need to be addressed during the data cleaning process.
